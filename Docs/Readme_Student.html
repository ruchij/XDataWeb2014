<ol>
  <li>The "View All Assignments" feature allows you to view all the assignments given to you. 
    You can select a desired assignment and view its details.</li>
  <li>The "View Present Assignment" feature displays the currently active assignments for easy access. 
   You have the same functionality here as "View All Assignments" feature.</li>
   <li> When you are viewing an assignment whose due date is not over, you will be able to answer questions, 
     or edit already answered questions.  If the assignment is in Learning Mode, you will get immediate feedback 
       when you save an answer to a question.  If the assignment is in graded mode, the assignment will be graded
      after expiry of the deadline; grading has to be manually initiated by your instructor.
       </li>
    <li> When a particular question is graded,  the system will tell you if all test cases generated for that question have
         been cleared by your query (i.e. your query gave the correct answers for those test cases), or if it failed some test 
           cases.  The system will try to provide hints on what the errors may be (but beware that the hints are often not
          very meaningful).
    </li>   
  <li>The "All Grades" feature allows you to view your grades for all the assignments whose due date is past.</li>
  <li>The "Grades of Present Assignment" feature displays the grades for currently active assignments for easy access. You have the same functionality here as "All Grades" feature.</li>
</ol>
